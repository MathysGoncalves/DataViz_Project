# DataViz Project - Mathys Goncalves M1BDIA

## Before...

I invite you to download this project locally to be able to use the prediction functionality by running the "Regression.ipynb" and using the comments relating to predictions in "Project.py". 

## Objectif

The objective of this project is to create a Streamlit application on the open data "Demandes de valeurs foncieres" obtained on the government site.

The visualizations used in this project allow the user to quickly obtain all the essential information about this dataset.

The ability to search on the ID is offered to the user.

The strong point of this project is the possibility of making a prediction according to certain criteria to obtain the land value. The model used is the one coded in "regression.ipynb" which is an ExtraTrees. 

The project is NOT focused on Machine Learning so the model is NOT accurate!
